This is a snapshot of the old influxdb client. The new client is being written, and has already replaced the old client's code (which broke some third party packages importing the influxdb client).
This snapshot should provide a temporary fallback for the thirdparty packages requiring the old influxdb client.

Please upgrade to the new influxdb client when that is completed.
